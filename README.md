# Retail Analytics & Exception Reporting Project

This project simulates a retail analytics environment focused on exception reporting, fraud pattern detection, KPI monitoring, and store-level data insights.  
It was built to demonstrate practical experience with workflows similar to those used in large retail environments, including Burberry’s Asset & Profit Protection (APP) structure.

## 📊 Project Objectives
- Build automated KPI and trend analysis reports  
- Analyse unusual transactions and operational anomalies  
- Simulate refund fraud, discount misuse and suspicious behaviour patterns  
- Create exception reports using SQL, Excel and Power BI  
- Perform data cleaning and integrity checks  
- Design dashboards for store performance, stock issues and digital transaction patterns
